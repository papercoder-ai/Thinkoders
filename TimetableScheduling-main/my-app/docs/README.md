## 🎯 Quick Start

### Understanding the System

1. Start with **[Architecture Overview](./01-architecture-overview.md)** for the big picture
2. Read **[Base Timetable Generation](./02-base-timetable-generation.md)** for core logic
3. Explore **[ILP Solver](./03-ilp-solver-constraint-programming.md)** for constraint programming
4. Learn **[GA Optimizer](./04-genetic-algorithm-optimizer.md)** for quality improvement

### Deep Dive

- **[Rules & Constraints](./07-scheduling-rules-constraints.md)**: What rules are enforced
- **[Database Schema](./08-database-schema.md)**: Data model details

### End-to-End

## 🔑 Key Concepts

### Two-Phase Approach

```
Phase 1: Base Generation (ILP/Greedy)
├── Schedule Labs (4 consecutive periods)
│   └── Using OR-Tools CP-SAT or Greedy search
└── Schedule Theory (distributed periods)
    └── Multi-start greedy with ILP fallback

Phase 2: Optimization (Genetic Algorithm)
├── Initialize population (50 variations)
├── Evaluate fitness (gaps, balance, preferences)
├── Evolve (selection, crossover, mutation)
└── Return best solution after 100 generations
```

### Hard vs Soft Constraints

| Hard Constraints | Soft Constraints |
|------------------|------------------|
| No double-booking | Minimize gaps |
| Room capacity | Balance workload |
| Faculty availability | Prefer morning |
| Lab = 4 periods | Labs early in week |

### Algorithm Comparison

| Algorithm | Purpose | Guarantee |
|-----------|---------|-----------|
| ILP (OR-Tools) | Find valid schedule | Optimal or infeasible |
| Greedy | Fast fallback | Valid but may miss slots |
| GA | Improve quality | Local optimum |

## 📊 System Performance

| Metric | Typical Value |
|--------|---------------|
| Lab scheduling | 1-5 seconds |
| Theory scheduling | <1 second |
| GA optimization | 2-10 seconds |
| Total generation | 5-15 seconds |

## ❓ Common Questions

### Why two phases?

1. **Base generation** ensures a valid schedule (satisfies hard constraints)
2. **Optimization** improves quality (minimizes soft constraint violations)

Combining them gives both correctness and quality.

### Why ILP for labs?

Labs have stricter requirements (4 consecutive periods, specific rooms). ILP guarantees finding a valid assignment if one exists, while greedy might fail on complex problems.

### Why GA instead of ILP for optimization?

GA handles soft constraints better (gaps, balance, preferences) while ILP is optimized for hard binary decisions. GA also runs faster for the "improve quality" task.

### Why multi-start greedy?

Different course orderings can lead to different schedules. By trying multiple orderings (priority-based, reverse, random), we increase the chance of finding a good solution without the complexity of full ILP.
