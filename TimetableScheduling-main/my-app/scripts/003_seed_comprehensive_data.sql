-- ==================== SUMMARY ====================
-- This script seeds:
-- - 17 Classrooms (11 theory, 7 labs)
-- - 15 Faculty members with availability schedules
-- - 25 Subjects (theory and lab)
--   * Labs have periods_per_week=1 (meaning 1 session of 4 continuous periods)
--   * Theory subjects have periods_per_week=2-3 (individual periods)
-- - 25 Subject-Faculty assignments
-- - 13 Sections across 4 departments
-- - 43 Section-Subject assignments
--
-- LAB SCHEDULING CONSTRAINT:
-- Each lab must be scheduled exactly ONCE per week as a 4-period block (P1-4 or P5-8)
-- The ILP solver handles this by scheduling labs as continuous 4-period blocks
--
-- Ready for timetable generation testing!
